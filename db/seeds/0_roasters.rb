So they decided to do it themselves, and set about researching Roasting Equipment, and coffee recipes. Countless gallons and kilos of coffee later, and they had their first and still most popular blend, Cafe Creme . Cafe Espresso soon followed, and from there Cafe Milano, and Cafe Roma, Superiore and San Marco, the ever evolving and growing Ponticelli® range soon grew a reputation for quality coffee, produced locally. Ponticelli®, literally meaning little bridges, was named after a suburb of Naples visited on a family holiday many years before.",

We have sampled a lot of coffee over the years, some good, some that made us want to remove our tongues with secateurs and occasionally coffee so delicious that it could inspire Shakespearean prose. We don't pretend to have a special formula, it was rather hit and miss really, but if you keep shooting you eventually hit the target (hence buckshot). We did however find a few key elements to roasting good coffee - quality ethically sourced green beans, a Giesen coffee roaster and finally a tonne of trial and error. We hope you enjoy our coffee as much as we do.",

Magnificent German engineering embodying our roasting principles: Methodical, Precision and Consistency; batch after batch. This 'Novoroaster' is a 'fluid-bed' or 'hot-air' roaster. This type of roasting produces a very 'clean' bean as opposed to drum roasting which is very smoky due to the oils released during each roast continually burning on the drum.
