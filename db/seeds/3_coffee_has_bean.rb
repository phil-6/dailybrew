Las Alasitas is the biggest farm of Fincas Buena Vista in Caranavi where, every year, a festival is held in honour of Ekeko (iqiqu), the god of abundance. It has everything in miniature – but in abundance, just like him!
'Buy me!' said Alasitas. And well, we did! It's all in the name...
Las Alasitas (which literally translates to 'buy me' in Aymaran) is owned by the Rodriguez family, who have been doing some awesome things for coffee in Bolivia. They own their own mills, processing and exporting coffee for farmers in the Caranavi and Sud Yungas region. The family has been sourcing coffee from small coffee producers for three decades, but the steady decline of coffee production has put the sustainability of their export business in jeopardy. Without the intervention of people like the Rodriguez family, the future of coffee production in Bolivia is at risk of disappearing.
Back in 2014, the Rodriguez family bought land in the Caranavi region to showcase their practices and educate other producers in sustainable farming, as well as increasing the overall volume at their mills.
Caranavi is located just north of the department of La Paz city, 150 kilometres from the capital, and is the central hub of Bolivian coffee production. Its altitude and fertile soils make it perfect for producing brilliant and unique coffees.
The Rodriguez family prepared the land they bought across 20.6 hectares, where they planted Red Caturra, Java and Geisha. They’ve also introduced a sustainable model for the producers who supply them at their mill. They built this on three mantras: economical sustainability, social understanding, and environmental awareness – the Sol de la Mañana program.
The family decided that they could make a change and make things better. They have taken on the challenge of increasing the production of Bolivian coffee by planting their own new coffee plantations. They are currently also developing woodland on their farm to combat the ongoing issue of deforestation. What superstars!
Las Alasitas is a 20.6 hectare farm that's located at 1,550 metres above sea level in the Bolinda colony of Caranavi, Bolivia. Of those 20 hectares, 16 are used to grow coffee.
A big sweet hit of rich, caramel like, speculoos biscuits is joined by a hint of cashew nut and a layer of milk chocolate for this gloopy, sweet and moreish coffee.

description: "DETAILS
A few years back we had a lot that was produced by various smallholder farmers from the small town of Copacabana, which lies about 180 kilometres from La Paz in the heart of the Caranavi coffee-producing region. Then in 2016 things changed a little, and the lot came from just one producer in the area. His name is Vincent Paye. That year we described him as a beacon of hope in a tough growing region, and that beacon has continued to shine brightly.
Caranavi is a lush and fertile region. It has steep slopes and valleys that provide excellent conditions for growing high-quality coffee, and they also support a diverse range of native flora and fauna. The area has rich volcanic soils and regular rainfall. Coffee growing heaven!
The colony of Copacabana has a collection of small farms that are each around five hectares in size (although Vincent has ten hectares). The farms range over an altitude of 1,300 to 1,700 metres above sea level (m.a.s.l.), and they benefit from an average annual temperature between 15 and 26°C. This lot comes from Vincent's farm, which is very similar to neighbouring farms and is at an altitude of around 1,550 m.a.s.l. These traditional farms use no chemicals or pesticides and follow the principles of organic farming not because of certification but because they want to look after their farms and land in the best way they possibly can.
The main harvest runs from May to September, peaking around July and August. The cherries are handpicked when they're fully ripe, and they're then delivered to the central mill, called Buena Vista, where they are fully washed.
Bolivia is a challenging origin and is going through some tough times: dwindling crops, ageing plants, lack of varietal diversity, and ageing producers with children who have little to no interest in carrying on the family business. But then there are people like Vincent who are doing wonderful work to buck that trend. He's been planting new stock, working hard alongside his family, and increasing his yield – as well as increasing the quality of his coffee.
Suffused with fruit sweetness, there's a juicy hit of satsuma and a little hint of passionfruit at the beginning. On the finish, the sweetness goes a bit darker with toffee notes, whilst the fruit returns on the aftertaste with raisin lingering on the tongue.

The Junqueira family started growing coffee on the highlands of southern Minas Gerais 150 years ago. The current owner is Tulio Junquiera. He's from the fifth generation of the family, and he's combined tradition with innovation to make Carmo Estate a sustainable farm dedicated to the production of specialty coffees. Tulio is also a former president of the Brazil Specialty Coffee Association (BSCA).
Carmo Estate’s mission is to produce exceptional coffees while providing its employees with a good quality of life and respecting the environment. The farm is located near the town of Heliodora in the southern state of Minas Gerais, which is a stunning region with mountainous terrain, mineral water springs, and ideal conditions to grow specialty coffees.
Carmo Estate has 220 hectares (545 acres) of land dedicated to the coffee varieties Mundo Novo, Catuaí, Catucaí, Bourbon, Acaiá and Icatú. The owners’ personal attention, the agronomists’ specialist supervision, and the fertile soil contribute to an average yield of 40 bags per hectare. That's more than twice the national average. Coffees from Carmo Estate are grown at altitudes ranging from 950 to 1,200 metres above sea level (3,100 to 3,900 feet).
The milling facilities at Carmo Estate were developed especially for the production of high-quality specialty Naturals and Pulped Naturals. The spacious drying patios are complemented by mechanical dryers, which are used when weather conditions are not favourable. The farm stores all of its coffee in wooden silos and has its own warehouse.
Carmo Estate is committed to the wellbeing of its employees and partners. Healthcare, on-site schooling for children, programmes to encourage workers to build their own housing, adult education projects, and the importance of environmental preservation are all hallmarks of the farm. Carmo Estate also runs an innovative profit-sharing programme, in which employees are invited to become partners in Carmo Estate and thus become entitled to a share of the profits earned from the sale of its coffee.
Simple can be delicious, and this is a great example. Think of a chocolate bar with bits of roasted hazelnuts and some almond in and you're there.

description: "DETAILS
This farm and its coffee sparked a massive change in what we thought we knew about coffee. We remember the first time we ever cupped this coffee: time stood still as the cup opened our minds to what great coffee is and can be. Gabriel de Carvalho Dias, the farmer, continues to produce great coffee year on year, and this coffee still holds a very special place in our hearts.
Gabriel is one of Brazil’s leading agronomists. His family owns several farms, all of which border one another. Fazenda Cachoeira da Grama is 417 hectares in size – that’s 4 square kilometres! That sounds huge, but it’s not uncommon for farms to be more than 1,000 hectares.
Because of the mountainous terrain, however, only 64 hectares are planted with coffee, and it's all picked and maintained by hand. The mill is located close to the spa town of Poços de Caldas, which is 45 minutes away from the farm.
Fazenda Cachoeira da Grama has been in the Carvalho Dias family since 1890. It's located in São Paolo state, just three miles from the border with Minas Gerais state. It enjoys the typical characteristics of the mountainous Mogiana and Sul de Minas regions, and it's located at an altitude of 1,100–1,250 metres above sea level.
Their farm has a school, a club and a full-sized soccer field for the employees and workers, and 47 houses – all with modern facilities. The wastewater is treated in order to avoid polluting the stream that runs across the farm. The farm has a small hydroelectric plant, and the farmers only buy energy during the peak harvest.
As well as providing support to the workers, the family have also invested in the farm's coffee processing facilities. This has allowed them to produce one of the most consistent and delicious coffees. They grow mostly Yellow Bourbon, but also Canario and Mundo Novo. It's well-established plant stock, and some of the original Bourbon varietal trees are as much as 108 years old.
They’ve also invested in trying new things, including planting some new varietals and trialling new fermentation experiments with the involvement of experts from the University of Lavras (UFLA) in Minas Gerais.
The Carvalho Dias family consider social and environmental sustainability to be very important. The farm has a programme of planting native species of trees to maintain a better ecological balance.
This one is super sweet and velvety - it’s all milk chocolate and hazelnuts, for the classic Brazilian coffee. There’s a little twist with some sweet red apple in there, but it’s classic again on the aftertaste with a gentle toffee.

description: "DETAILS
Here at Hasbean we love to celebrate the awesome things that happen when strong relationships are built between roasters and producers, and Finca Licho is a shining example of that ethos. We first bought from this farm way back in 2007 when it was awarded 4th place in the Cup of Excellence. Fast forward fourteen years (gosh, feeling old now), and Licho has become a firm favourite – both with customers and our little Hasbean team. The arrival of coffees from Finca Licho is greatly anticipated every year.
The farm is owned and run by Los Hermanos Aguilera. It's often translated as 'The Aguilera Brothers', but everyone is involved, not just the boys! The family of twelve brothers and sisters inherited the business from their parents, who started their coffee-growing career over 50 years ago.
With the help of the third generation, the family work the farm with basically no hired labour except for during the harvest. They manage the mill and drying patios, fertilise, prune the coffee trees, and so on. They do it all themselves, and all year round. The Aguileras have a reputation for their deep understanding of quality at the farm and mill level, and this is why we are excited about working with them. If you'd like to keep up with the family you can do so over on Instagram, make sure to give @aguilerabrothers a follow!
Situated 1,500 metres above sea level in the region of Naranjo, the farm is located in the volcanic Northern Cordiles corridor of the Western Valley, which is an area famous for its excellent coffee production. The majority of the coffee grown at Finca Licho is Villa Sarchi variety, but there's a smidge of Caturra too (they're about 65% and 25% of production respectively). The remainder of coffee production is made up of a mixture of more unusual varieties, some of which we've been able to snag this year now that they're established enough to provide a crop.
Kicking off with dark brown sugar, there’s a delicate fermentation edge/funk from the natural processing before an exciting zing of lime. On the aftertaste that sweetness lingers, joined by an edge of dried currants.

Buying coffee is simple, right? A farmer has coffee, you have money...easy! Well, not so much. One of the realities of coffee farming is unscrupulous coffee buyers turning up, promising the world and then not honouring their promises. For this reason, we never ask too much of the producers we work with for the first few years - you have to earn trust. Eventually, they trust us to be reliable and keep coming back. In the case of the Aguileras...well, it took them a number of years to warm to us. That’s just how it goes sometimes.

This coffee is a Pacamara and here at Hasbean, we really like Pacamaras. They can be a little tricky to roast and tricky to brew, are big ol' beans too, but massively worth the effort as we think they're incredibly unique and delicious! It's a varietal that came from two quite different varietals and the name Pacamara came from its parents - Pacas and Maragogype.
Pacas is a natural and spontaneous mutation of Bourbon, El Salvador's answer to Villa Sarchi in Costa Rica or Caturra in Brazil, it thrived in the El Salvadorian climate where it was first found, but is very happy in other Central American countries too. Maragogype (pronounced mah-rah-go-heep-eh) is another natural mutation but this time of Typica, however it really puts the MUTANT in mutation as it's a huge varietal and where Pacamara gets its bigger size from.
So how did they meet? No not at a bar on or Hinge, but in the Genetic Department of the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) back in 1958. There was a coffee breeding program using lots of varietals, these two of many, and after a great deal of work, seed distribution and trial and error, Pacamara became the amazing varietal we know it as today. For a more detailed rundown of the history of the Pacamara varietal, please have a read of the article we have on its history here.
First off in the cup is a big squeeze of lemon and lime, but balanced by white sugar sweetness and a silky body. As it cools a fraction, this gets more complex with a tropical twist of pineapple juice alongside the citrus and an unusual lemongrass note on the finish.

Brewing TipPacamaras have a very unique size, density and structure, so don't expect them to grind like any other coffee. We find going a little finer than you normally would and allowing more time for the grinder to get its teeth into the bigger beans often leads to delicious results.
Roasting InformationMedium - let this one run through first crack and finish just at the end of the gap, so we get the lively citrus zing and intense, simple sweetness preserved.

description: "DETAILS
*Please note - this coffee is sold in 125g bags, not our regular 250g*
This coffee comes from the Tarrazú region of Costa Rica, which is a really rather famous region because of its coffee-growing - as well as being a favourite scenic location among Costa Ricans. A little cooler and wetter than the Western Valley, Tarrazu is steep and lush, with farms and tiny villages dotted among the rolling hills around the small towns of San Marcos, Santa Maria de Dota and Leon Cortes (which the mill is near to).
The Puente Tarrazu mill is quite large by Costa Rican standards and processes coffee from both their own farms and from some of their neighbours. That said, it’s still pretty small compared to a large mill n another Central American country!
Finca El Potrero is owned by Don Rudolpho Riviera - one of the Puente Tarrazu co-owners. It's around 22 hectares in size, with 20 of those involved in coffee production. They're around 1,600 meters above sea level, but let me tell you that’s very approximate - getting around the farm is hard work as it’s very steep! The plants here are fairly well established - in fact, these Geisha plants are 10 years old now. That’s good news at the moment as you don’t get much crop (if any) for the first three years and Geisha has a reputation of taking a couple of years more for the amazing floral and citrus qualities to really start coming through. That puts Rudolpho’s plants in their peak right now, and we think you’ll agree this comes through in the cup.
On this farm, the Geisha plants have been allowed to grow tall and flexible on the steep hillside, forming a dense forest you have to weave your way through, pulling the branches down to pick the cherries when they’re ripe. This lets the coffee plants create their own shade, but there are also lots of citrus plants including lemons, limes & limon mandarina mixed in as well as lots of other plants. Keeping a diverse range of plants on the farm helps give back nutrients to the soil and retain water - very important on these steep slopes which are so difficult to access.
The farm has Caturra, Bourbon (which we also buy) and this - the Geisha. It’s a varietal which shot to fame around 2010 with it’s massive floral and citrus flavours but was hiding for years before that in the backwaters of Costa Rica. Rather gangly and not particularly robust as coffee plants grow, it’s not an easy candidate to farm, but works well here.
From the farm, ripe cherries are driven 15 minutes or so over to the mill. Puente Tarrazu is unusual in continuing to process using a wide variety of methods - everything from Fully Washed through to Natural is done at the mill, but it’s up to the expert judgement of Rudolpho and his team to chose which method suits each lot and how to manage that method to get the absolute best results out. For this Geisha, he’s opted for a Yellow Honey. If you would like to find out a little more about honey processing, please take a few moments to visit our guide here.
Richly perfumed and floral, there's an unusual, delicate lavender note. The white sugar sweetness and orange finish provide a perfect balance to these high notes and round out the final cup.

Colombia El Yalcon
Here at Hasbean, we're always on the lookout for tasty and delicious decaf. It can sometimes be a little tricky to get our hands on, but we aim to always have at least 1 decaffeinated coffee available at all times.
As crops come and go during the year, our decaf offering changes and rolls with the seasons - right now it is a washed Caturra from El Yalcon in Colombia that has been decaffeinated using sugar cane. Please note - if you sign up for a recurring subscription to this coffee, you will always be sent our current decaf offering.
El Yalcon decaf is grown along an isolated set of mountains within the central cordillera of the Andes that go through Pitalito, Acevedo, Palestina, Timaná, and Suaza. This coffee represents the work of 24 different individual producers from the municipalities of La Plata, Nataga, Paez, Pital, and Tesalia. The producers are committed to quality and excellence.
Coffee is carefully hand-sorted and processed at each individual farm, with special attention paid to the drying process to ensure consistency, uniformity, and a clean cup profile.
It was decaffeinated in Colombia. This might not sound remarkable, but most coffee is decaffeinated in either Canada or Germany. This adds food miles to the coffee, which is not good. What decaffeination in a coffee’s producing country does is add value at the place where I’m very happy to add value; that is, around 40km from the warehouse where the shipments are collated.
Take a look at the blog post here for more information on how the coffee is decaffeinated. 'SC' stands for sugar cane, because the decaffeination agent ethyl acetate is naturally derived from sugar cane.
Someone's put a spoonful of treacle in this coffee. There's a little orange zest in there too and milk chocolate on the aftertaste, but sweet, dark treacle is what this one is all about.

producer: "Alejandro Martinez", 
description: "DETAILS
Finca Argentina is based in the Apaneca-Ilamtepec mountain range, near the town of Turin in the Ahuachapán department. The beautiful 35-hectare farm has natural hot springs dotted all over, and is situated at an altitude of 1300 metres above sea level. Our very dear friend Alejandro Martinez owns the farm along with his father Mauricio, who inherited the land along with a handful of other coffee farms in the region from Guillermo Martinez, MD (Ale's grandfather) back in 2008.
The family currently have 2 farms locally, the other being called Finca Manuella, that they run with the help of a farm manager and approximately 25-30 staff during the non-picking season. Argentina have taken a supportive approach with their labour: this team have been with the farm for 6 years now and work on maintaining and tending to the plants year-round. The number of workers goes up to 50 during the busy harvest period, including the staff members' families who also participate in the harvest cycle to help them complement their income. Furthermore, Ale and Mauricio host a yearly lunch with the crew to thank them for their hard work, and plant corn on the land for their employees and each staff member gets about 50 lbs annually to help support their families. They have also been contributing labour and materials to support the necessary improvements to the access road for the community. This is a joint effort with the municipality, community leaders and a few other local farmers.
Hasbean has been working with the family since back in 2008, and in that time our relationship has gone from strictly professional to Ale being a close friend of the business. He became involved in coffee after relocating to El Salvador from New York, where he'd been working as a city banker. With his son Lukas on the way and the hustle and bustle of New York, no place to bring up a family, the draw of home and El Salvador was just far too strong to ignore. While looking for work in El Salvador, Ale decided to help his father with some of his business interests and investments, including the coffee farms he had just inherited.
One of the investments pricked Alé’s interest, and this was a farm called Finca Argentina. The reason it really got Alé's attention was that he saw the farm once yielded loads of coffee but was producing a fraction of its old productivity. His father gave him permission to see what could be done to make the farm successful again. Historically, Argentina used to produce on average 1,250 quintales (1 quintal = 100 pounds) with some years even producing 1,500 or at the very highest harvest roughly 2,000, however, the productivity levels had gone right down to 400-500 quintales by the time Ale started looking into it.
Alé began working the farm with more attention and better management in general (pruning, shading control, fertilisation etc) and managed to get the harvest back to 1,100 quintales right before Roya devastated the crop the following year. In 2013 they suffered the worst harvest on record, with only 70 bags harvested due to the massive issue with leaf rust - from 1,100 qq down to 200 qq... In Ale's own words \"brutal\"! Since 2013 the approach has been to renovate the farm with younger trees and to diversify the varieties from the vast majority being mainly Bourbon, with the goal of the plant stock being more resilient and able to handle disease. It has been slow going since their other farm, Manuela, took precedence for replanting and so far about 60-70% of the farm has been replanted.
Since then, Finca Argentina has gone from strength to strength, but not without bumps in the road. With investment and hard work, the future is amazingly bright for Ale, his father, his family and Finca Argentina. Things are also looking up for the local fauna as the farm has, over the last five years, transitioned to a more ecological management utilising compost and other organic products to minimise impact to the environment. Such management has led to more biodiversity: the team have seen deer at the farm as well as several species of birds, frogs, and snakes, and they noticed it has also helped improve cup quality.
Alongside these measures, they have also intercropped beans to enrich the soil in some areas of the plantation, the harvests from which serve as a bonus to the workforce alongside their corn provisions.
The farm is broken down into 7 areas or tablons, these are approximately 6 hectares in size each, but there are some smaller due to their location and other landscape characteristics:

The highest tablon is San Jorge at 1,300-1,360 m.a.s.l. and is 2 hectares in size
Fincona 2 is the most productive tablon at a size of 8 hectares, sitting at between 1,250-1,300 m.a.s.l. and is where this coffee comes from
Fincona 1 is 4 hectares, sat at 1,200-1,250 m.a.s.l. The coffee plants here are intercropped with macadamia nut trees
Guachipelin is 6 hectares in size, and in 2016 was replanted with H1, Yellow Bourbon, Icatu and a small amount of Kenya/SL-28.
Los Mangos, also 6 hectares, is where this coffee is from. It's also the location of a volcanic vent with boiling mud areas!
Piletas is 6 hectares large and was replanted in 2020. This is the lowest area of the farm at about 1,150-1,200 m.a.s.l.
4 Manzanas (3 hectares in size) was replanted in 2018 with Portillo


The name of this tablon, Los Mangos, means (as you probably guessed!) the \"Mangoes\", and is named after the mango trees planted there. It's about 10 manzanas (hectares) of land and most of the tablon is on a gentle slope. The main characteristic of the tablon is that it's close to the \"Ausol\" (a volcano vent that you can see from the farm, the actual fumes end up spitting from the neighbour's property on to this land).
The Ausol's route out actually passes underground near the land so the soil in this area can get really hot. There's even a small vent in this tablon that actually melts the rock and mud and smells like sulfur. The main drawback on this land is no one knows what direction the Ausol is taking and where it will show up next. On the land where it flows, nothing grows, and if it changes route, it kills the plants.
70% of plant stock in El Salvador is the Bourbon variety, this heirloom variety is one of the reasons why coffee from this country is right up amongst some of the best in the world. They have the perfect climate and conditions for this low yielding, high maintenance strain. Over the years Ale has been at the head of a vast amount of variety experimentation at Finca Argentina, trialling all sorts of less heard of plant types on sectioned-off areas of the farm. You might remember some super interesting multipacks from us in the past featuring the triumphs (and failures... all interesting to us nerds!) of this project. More recently the team have been focussed on working with those lots that have proven successful and of benefit to the farm. This year we've got a handful of winners hitting our green stores: Bourbon, Centroamericano H1, Icatu, Obata, and Kanya. All of the Washed processing is handled off the farm at a large mill nearby that is owned by Alejandro's cousin, and Naturals are processed themselves on a small scale in a greenhouse on the farm.
There's a sweet, creamy base to this coffee but with a big hit of yellow fruit - think dried mango and yellow plums for a burst of funky fruit.

description: "DETAILS
Rafael and Carmen De Silva were the first producers we ever met in El Salvador, and Finca La Fany was the first farm Hasbean ever visited in El Salvador. This is a relationship that goes all the way back to 2003, and we consider to be a real foundation stone coffee for Hasbean.
Finca La Fany has been producing coffee in El Salvador since 1870, and it's belonged to the same family from generation to generation. Situated on the Santa Ana volcano, the farm provides work for 24 families in the community. It's in a biological corridor that stretches for 27 hectares from Mexico to Panama. It grows mostly Bourbon, but also has a small amount of Pacamara.
Carmen and Rafael continually invest in the milling of their own coffee and improving the facilities they have, which has really driven this shade-grown coffee to just get better and better year after year. We think you can really taste the continuous development in the cup; this is one of our all-time favourites, and it's one of the coffees that we'd be absolutely devastated to lose if we were ever unable to get it.
A very balanced and clean coffee which starts with milk chocolate before turning towards green apple and white grape. A deliciously uncomplicated and chuggable coffee.

description: "DETAILS
Gloria Mercedes Rodríguez Fontan is a name you will probably recognise from a coffee we've had every year for many years, the always awesome Finca San José, check out this year's crop here. She's a fourth-generation coffee grower and owns + personally supervises six small farms located in the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain range: San José, Mamatita, El Porvenir, Nejapa, Nueva Granada and La Lagunita. This coffee comes from the specific Roma tablón of Nejapa, we last had coffee this farm way back in 2015 and are really excited to see it back in 2021.
Finca Nejapa was inherited by Gloria’s father, José María Rodríguez Herrera, in the 50s. At that time the property was only devoted to cattle for milking purposes, and it was José Maria who started growing coffee of the Bourbon variety. Little by little, he noticed coffee was extremely productive in that area.
The farm has 18.2 hectares of land in total, of which 6.3 hectares are dedicated to growing coffee. The coffee-growing area is divided into three separate plots or 'tablóns'; Los Vientos (2.1 hectares), Santa Marta (1.4 hectares), and Roma (2.8 hectares). The latter is where this coffee comes from.
Nejapa has also 7 hectares of land that was reforested with cedar trees and a diverse range of shade trees, which helps maintain and preserve both the soil conditions and a wide variety of birds and small mammals that can be seen in the region.
This farm is on the slopes of the Laguna de Las Ninfas (which translates as “water lilies lagoon”). It has a spectacular sight over the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain range, including the impressive Itzalco volcano, and even over the Pacific Ocean and the port of Acajutla.
Tablón Roma is located on the western side of Finca Nejapa. It has belonged to the family over four generations but was left unplanted until relatively recently. That's when Gloria obtained a loan through a local investment bank to redevelop and re-plant this area. The variety chosen for this plot was Caturra; in those days it was in vogue to plant this short-size producing tree with good yields, and it was needed to repay the loan. Happily, variety and terroir combined to result in great quality coffee.
The name ROMA was chosen by combining the first two letters of the names of her children, Roberto and María Jose. This farm was awarded in the El Salvador Cup of Excellence in 2008 and 2009.
Each year Gloria employs around 35 people during the harvesting season, and all year round she manages a permanent \"winter works\" team of 15 people. The idea is to have a solid trained and skilled working group that receive better wages and working conditions. Gloria pays during harvest around 90% above the legal minimum wage to give workers incentive and assure the best coffee cherries possible. After every production cycle, she gives a proportional bonus according to every week of labour of her “winter workers” that normally derives into 1.2 months extra of income for them.
Gloria works under strict specialty coffee standards. These include fully ripe cherries harvest, careful milling, appreciative pruning, etc. She is blessed with amazing coffee terroir conditions such as altitude and sandy loam soils rich in organic matter, among others. Coffee pickers are selected from her staff based on their experience and passion, and their understanding of the requirements to obtain high-quality coffee. She supervises the whole process directly with the support of Antonio Avelino, her farm foreman.
Who's chocolate orange is this? We couldn't possibly say, but it's right there in this coffee! A classic for the chocoholics amongst us, but with just a delicate raspberry on the finish adding a little twist.

description: "DETAILS
Finca San José is very much the pride and joy of the Rodríguez family, and it's now in the hands of a fourth and fifth generation of coffee producers. The story begins in 1815 when José María Rodriguez and Josefina Rodriguez (great-grandparents) planted the first coffee trees with their own hands.
Through the generations, the farm has passed through the hands of many committed farmers; farmers like José's son, Israel Rodriguez. He was then followed by Jose Maria Rodriguez. Jose Maria took care of the farm until it came to Gloria Mercedes Rodriguez Fontán. Gloria is the most recent owner.
Ever the strong woman, Gloria has overcome gender barriers in an industry that has historically been the province of men, and she personally supervises every step at the farm level. Gloria not only takes care of San José but, together with her siblings' support, she manages five other small farms that collectively add up to thirty-eight hectares.
The mountain slopes of Finca San José are fully shaded by trees that help to maintain and preserve the crop and the surrounding environment. In addition to the trees' diversity, the farm is home to a variety of wild animals and birds, which can be seen in their natural habitat. San José is nested in the northwestern slope of an extinct volcanic crater, which holds a small lagoon inside it. The lagoon is named Nymph Lagoon, due to the abundance of water lilies.
Coffee at Finca San José goes through extensive quality control. It's also grown under standards that support specialty coffee production. The unique microclimate conditions include an average altitude of 1,500 metres above sea level, an average temperature of 17°C, and rich and loamy clay soil; and the coffee grown is mainly Red Bourbon.
This very small lot resulted from a very lucky varietal observation inside Gloria’s own farms by her son-in-law, Luis Rodriguez. During the previous harvest at Finca San José , while walking around the farm checking for ripeness, Luis ended up in front of a huge cluster of cherries which grabbed his attention. He realized that this, right here, was a very interesting tree. With the help of Gloria, Maria Jose and Antonio, he harvested roughly twelve kilos of cherries that they called 'Bourbon on steroids', which were then hand-processed by Antonio.
Everything about this plant phenotype fascinated him and he concluded this was something to definitely follow up on. One of the most interesting features he noticed was the amount of mucilage inside each cherry, which was just over twice as much as in other varieties found at the farm.
After a few weeks Antonio had a sample processed and ready enough to cup. After a small cupping performed at their house Luis fell in love with the amazing fruit character and sweetness behind this puzzling varietal. At present the varietal is still being scrutinised by a few local geneticists, but while they await official results the family have temporarily given it the name 'Elefante', because of the bigger size of this cherry compared to Bourbon, which is the more common variety grown on the farm.
Gloria and some of her more experienced workers believe this may be one line of the famous Bourbon selected by the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) while in the process of making the improved Bourbon known as Tekisic. The name Tekisic comes from tekiti, a word meaning “work” in the Nahuatl language, which was very apt as ISIC spent nearly 30 years performing selections to create it, beginning in 1949 and culminating with its release in 1977. Some of these lines were spread in areas of El Salvador, including Apaneca; however, further investigation is still being undertaken by Luis and his family.
An elegant cup, this balances spritzy, crisp white grape and lime zest against sweet mango and orange. There's a dark chocolate note which comes in on the aftertaste.

Fabio Morán and Etifanio Silva decided to conquer this hostile territory back in 1870, sowing coffee trees on one of the highest summits of the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain range. They named the 28 hectares of land 'Siberia' for its chaotic weather conditions and its difficult accessibility. The name was very apt really.
One century later, Rafael Silva inherited the property.
Siberia is 1,450 metres above sea level and only grows shade-grown coffee. There are two main varietals grown on the farm, and 75% of production is Bourbon varietal while the other 25% is Pacamara. This lot is 100% Bourbon.
The names Carmen and Rafael De Silva might be familiar to lovers of El Salvadorian coffee. That'll be because they're the owners of one of our favourite farms: La Fany. We visited both La Fany and Siberia farms with Rafael and Carmen way WAY back in 2007.
We bought their coffee and loved it, but it fell off of the radar a little. El Salvador is somewhere we have worked very hard, and we have some amazing friends and coffees, but somehow the Siberia farm ended up getting lost to us 🙁
Fast forward to 2012 and the Cup of Excellence. This sample hit our table and we were wowed. Really wowed! So much so that we bought the coffee at a crazy price and you snapped it up. We raved about it, and thought it only right to follow up on it.
In fact, the Siberia farm is highly decorated. It's been among the Cup of Excellence winners in the years 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2012.
Siberia is located in the Cerro El Aguila canton. That's between Santa Ana and Chalchuapa, and in the region of Santa Ana and the Apaneca-Ilamatepec mountain range. This estate is exactly on the other side of the mountain from La Fany, the farm which we love so much.
Pecan nut here gets a big dollop of it's favourite partner, caramel! The finish brings a little bit of dried fruit and currants, which shifts into orange zest on the aftertaste.

description: "DETAILS
We first came across this coffee all the way back in 2016 after being introduced by the importers that we worked with in Ethiopia at the time. We have been buying from Ana Sora consistently ever since and it's safe to say that this is one of our most popular coffees – when it goes out of season we're flooded with emails asking when it's going to come back... well, happy days are here again! We see a lot of consistency from this coffee and year-on-year it always delivers with those clean blueberry/floral flavours and a little bit of seasonal variation. We always blind cup pre-shipment samples and when we come to this bowl we often say “Ooooh I hope this is the new Ana Sora!” and lo and behold it is, it's a super distinctive coffee. It's our sixth year of roasting this coffee and Ana Sora is now the Ethiopian farm that we buy the most volume from as, for good reason, it's just so popular with everyone!
Ana Sora is a private farm owned by second-generation coffee farmer Israel Degfa. He grew up immersed in various aspects of the coffee industry as his father was a mill manager and his mum sold coffee to commuters in the local bus station. Because he grew up in a coffee producing area, he shows great respect for the farmers, both as business partners and as people. As coffee farms go, Ana Sora is a very new farm: it was only formed in 2013. Coffee trees take an average 2-3 years to produce a crop of cherries that's big enough to sell, so we started buying soon after it first went on the market. It's located at a whopping altitude of between 1,900 and 2,350 metres above sea level. It's a gorgeous but somewhat tiring walk to get there - it's not all just holiday snaps, this coffee buying malarkey!
The estate is located in the Guji Zone in the South of Ethiopia, due East of the town of Yirgacheffe. It’s western neighbour is Uraga and to the East is Adola - both places where Israel owns mills as well. Broadly speaking there are 5 primary coffee producing regions in Ethiopia; Sidamo, Limu, Yirgacheffe (a subsection of Sidamo), Harrar, and Djima – each presenting characteristic flavour profiles. Guji coffees have historically been sold as Sidamo coffees, but today they are thought of as separate and are being more properly marketed as such. The local area is known for coffees with bright acidity and juicy, fruity flavours, often with a tea-like body. It is unusual to find private farms of 250 hectares in Ethiopia (the norm being smallholder gardens of less than 2 hectares each) and even more unusual to find them at such high altitudes. Ethiopian coffee farms are high in general compared to other producing countries (mostly between 1,700 - 2,100 masl) but Ana Sora is on the higher side still, reaching as high as 2,350 masl. The altitude helps with the slower maturation of the coffee cherry, with temperatures averaging between 16-19ºC allowing more time for the plant to develop, which contributes to the super unique cup profile.
Coffee growing is popular locally, and Israel also sources coffee from the surrounding area. Each washing station has around 1000-2000 members, each with one of the small home coffee plots typical of Ethiopia, producing very small quantities. The area is populated by smallholder farmers who speak Oromife and are of Oromo ethnicity. In his role as CEO of producing and exporting company Kerchanshe, Israel believes in helping these farmers through education in husbandry, and also through financial assistance. Their passion for fine coffee is coupled with consistent reinvestment not only in improved infrastructure, technology and processes, but Kerchanshe also invests 10% of its annual profits into social responsibility programs such as building schools and providing clean water to the communities it serves. Israel has already built schools in Adola and Kercha and is currently constructing schools in Gelana Gesha and Kilenso Mokonesa.
The farm used to only produce Naturally processed coffee, however in 2018 the farmers decided to take advantage of the river Turo nearby and built a washing station capable of producing washed coffee using the river as their water source. Since then Ana Sora has produced both Washed and Natural lots and we're super happy to have both for you!
Kicking things off is a floral note, with lemon following hot on its heels. A white sugar sweetness carries through, finishing alongside a clean black tea flavour. The whole thing has a delicate but silky body.

El Bosque sits on a hillside that runs parallel to the main road to Guatemala City. Due to its proximity to the capital, it faces threats from ever-expanding urban development. However, during the time we have been working with El Bosque, prices and returns for the farm have made it a much higher concern for the brothers, and they are very motivated.
Before we'd tried this coffee at El Bosque, it was love at first taste, we were absolutely blown away by how good it was! However, our first visit to the farm in January 2007 really cemented this, because we got to learn more about the awesome people behind the coffee.
Julian Flores founded the farm in 1932. The fourteen-hectare extension of land was planted out with Bourbon varietal coffee, which was cultivated and sold in cherry form only. Over the next few years, with the acquisition of more land, the farm continued to grow. Julian Flores passed away in 1947, and his son, José Eladio Flores, inherited the farm and continued his father’s legacy of growth. By 1970, José had bought another 23 hectares and continued to grow and sell the same Bourbon coffee varietal. After his death in 1996, a third-generation has taken the farm on under the direction of José’s widow, Martha Stalla, and their sons Julio, José, Francisco and Mario.
This third-generation, headed up by Don Roberto, has focused on innovation, and they have built a plant for processing the cherries in line with strict environmental guidelines. They have also branched into cultivating other plants for local consumption. These include plants such as avocados, roses and lemons, and they're also growing a new grass innovation.
An all rounder and easy drinker, it's like malted milk biscuits and milk chocolate got blended up with roasted hazelnuts. There's a delicate green apple which balances it with some freshness, but this is a sweet, simple crowd pleaser.

description: "DETAILS
A desire to experiment is one of the big reasons that we love buying from San Patricio El Limon; we've been getting coffee from them since first introduced seven years ago by our mutual friend Raul Rodas (2012 World Barista Champion), and they're just getting more and more awesome each year.
The experimentation is thanks to the motivation of Guadalupe Alberto Reyes (known as Beto to his friends), he's been the owner of the farm for 21 years now, and in recent years has really focussed on the farm and on continually striving to improve. He aims to take more care in every step they take on the farm, from picking, to processing, to shipping. Beto's son, Saul, has been studying agronomy at the local college for the past seven years, and he uses his knowledge to benefit practices on the farm.
All the family has a part to play in the day-to-day running of the farm, including Beto's wife Maralyn, their children Saul, Elena, and Betio; Betio's wife Mafer; and Beto's brother Felix, who runs their mill. In addition to the family, they employ a team of seven workers outside of harvest. That team manages the weeding, mill upgrades and general farm work.
The farm itself is eighteen hectares in size and sits at an altitude between 1,350–1,850 meters above sea level. The farm mainly produces Caturra and Bourbon but has also recently started growing SL28, H1, H3, Maracaturra, Maragogype, Geisha, Pacamaras, Caturras and Catuaí (yellow and red). In addition, around 8 water reservoirs have been built around the entire farm in order to preserve this vital liquid and help ensure the sustainability of the farm.
It is located roughly an hour's drive to the east of Guatemala City in the small town of Palencia, which Beto also happens to be Mayor of! He has helped to build and develop the town alongside running his farm – honestly have no idea how he finds enough hours in the day, what a guy!
Palencia is not part of the eight regions of coffee as defined by Anacafé (the National Association of Coffee in Guatemala), but you can see a lot of development in the zone, and this farm is a perfect example of that development. As a coffee buying business, we've always liked being in places that are working to be hot and up-and-coming, as well as those that are established players. Over time El Limon has become one of our favourite Hasrelationships, and back in 2013, they were the first producers that we ever bought from directly in Guatemala.
The dedication and care devoted to each step of production is reflected in the fact that the family operates their own wet mill, so that they can separate different lots and have control over the quality of the coffee. They are able to process many lots simultaneously and keep separate days' pickings, processes, and varietals in their own parcels. The wet mill also benefits the local community as neighbours within the region of Palencia also bring their coffees to the mill to be processed.
They have had the mill on-site since the very beginning but it's very much an ongoing project and they recently invested in a rebuild, alongside the construction of a QC laboratory, a new warehouse, and accommodation for their staff. Beto doesn't want to stand still and is continuing to invest in the farm. You can tell that this is a farm on top of their game. Whenever we visit, all questions are dispatched with exactly the right answer and every suggestion is listened to and taken on board.
There's orange at the start, but with almond frangipane quickly joining it, then milk chocolate and raisin joining in for a more-ish meddle and a super chuggable coffee.

Brewing TipPacamaras have a very unique size, density and structure, so don't expect them to grind like any other coffee. I find going a little finer than I normally would and allowing more time for the grinder to get its teeth into the bigger beans often leads to delicious results.
Roasting InformationMedium-dark – Keep a steady pace through first crack, into the gap and up to the edge of second crack, but not more than the first few pops as it cools.

A wonderfully straight forward, easy drinking coffee, it's a mash up of bourbon biscuits and brown sugar. There's a delicate green apple acidity in there and a little walnut on the finish too, which gives it that great balance which makes you empty a cup and go back for another.

description: "DETAILS
Finca La Escondida is close to Lake Apanas near the city of Jinotega, which is the capital of the department of Jinotega in the north-central region of Nicaragua. The straight translation from Spanish to English of 'escondida' is ‘hidden’. Escondida is called 'Escondida' because the farm is 'hidden' from the road by forest and trees, which makes it appear to blend right into the side of the mountain.
The first coffee trees were planted at La Escondida 'just' fifteen years ago in 2006 and this makes, in the grand scheme of coffee farm things, La Escondida still a rather young farm. The farm was planned around identifying the plots with individually different micro-environments resulting from factors such as soil quality, sun exposure and temperature range. This is one of the upsides of planting a new farm: getting to plan ahead!
Some of the downsides of starting a brand new farm can be that it may take a while for the quality of the cup profile to build up, it might take time to have the right facilities for processing and picking, and it might take time to train the staff for picking and processing. Not to mention that it might take a while to achieve the yield to go with it all. But this farm, for us, has hit the whole group of requirements running. As a result of their experience in the area, the Mierisch family have built a new mill with a huge investment, and they utilised some of the people already in place in the neighbouring 'San Jose' farm to blend together an Escondida team comprising experienced and new members.
The varietal of this lot is Red Catuai. The owners selected it for the farm because they thought it would do well with the soil quality, sun exposure, temperature range and weather conditions, given the farm's quite exposed on the side of the mountain.
Fresh red apple balances against sweet caramel, but then the aftertaste brings a rich cocoa for a great, well-balanced coffee.

The story of Hasbean and Finca Limoncillo is a long and exciting one - we've been working together for 13 years now! A bakers' dozen of coffee harvests shared between Matagalpa and Stafford make us very happy customers. We've been telling the story of this relationship for many years now and we don't intend to stop any time soon because it's such a big, big, big relationship for us! So much of where we are today has come from this relationship. We're super proud of everything that's happened in the past, and super excited for where we can go in the future.
Limoncillo (and a handful of other fantastic farms) are owned by Dr. Erwin Mierich. Having previously lived and worked in the USA, he returned to Nicaragua in the mid-1990s. He explained, \"While I was living in the United States, I worked as a gynaecologist, but then I had to come back to Nicaragua and lead this farm. Coffee has been my passion since I was a little boy\".
Our relationship with Finca Limoncillo began in 2007, and back then we were buying their delicious coffee as part of a buying group. We cupped the coffee and instantly loved it - We had to have it! It was a wonderful surprise to discover after the auction closed that it was owned by a family in Nicaragua who were already good friends of ours! The following year we visited the farm with our Nicaraguan importers and agreed that they would bring the coffee into the UK for us.
A few years ago we were notified by the importers that they would not be buying the coffee again (for reasons other than the cup quality) which led to some frantic phone calls on our part, and a dig down the back of the sofa for enough loose change to fund buying 12 months' worth of coffee all in one go. There were many, many obstacles in the way of doing this deal, but we were lucky in that we were able to pull everything together in a very short amount of time. The upside of all of this is that we now work directly with Finca Limoncillo instead of going via anyone else. This coffee has gone from a one-off Cup of Excellence buy to a fantastic long-term relationship that we're so very proud to have.
Finca Limoncillo is located in the Matagalpa region of Nicaragua and it's a whopping 171 hectares in size, which is heckin chonky! 109 hectares of this is used for coffee cultivation, with the remainder used to raise cattle and horses, and left to natural woodland. The family have heaps of policies and initiatives to make everything as sustainable as possible on this vast farming area: their use of chemicals is minimal, and the impact on the environment is always minimised by careful and considerate land management.
It's owned and run by the Mierisch family who are, by now, very close friends, and well-respected producers in Nicaragua. They're known for their experimental processing, varietal work, and exceptional coffee. The family employ over 3000 staff during the harvest, and at Limoncillo over 60 families live on the farm full time. They are seriously loved by the guys who work for them, more than any other producer we buy from there is genuine love and respect between the family and their workers. The fact that the family are our friends helps us drill down into the details of what they do for the people who work for them. On the farm, the family:

The employers pay their staff 30% more than what is typical minimum wage, as well as:
Provide free housing for 60 families on their farms
Provide free electricity and running water for their homes
Provide free food for all workers
Have free daycare facilities for families to use
Provide free health care facilities on the farms
Employee on-site teachers who educate their staff and teach other skills such as pottery and weaving. The goal is to help staff diversify their skills. The teachers are also paid twice the wages they would receive in the cities.

A fantastically fruity and sweet coffee where you'll find yellow plum in every sip. There's some orange on the finish as well as a little black grape on the aftertaste.

This is a Pacamara varietal coffee. Pacamaras are a little crazy on the cupping table. Pacamaras are exciting. Here at Hasbean, we really like Pacamaras! It's a varietal that came from two quite different varietals and the name Pacamara came from its parents - Pacas and Maragogype.
Pacas is a natural and spontaneous mutation of Bourbon, El Salvador's answer to Villa Sarchi in Costa Rica or Caturra in Brazil, it thrived in the El Salvadorian climate where it was first found, but is very happy in other Central American countries too. Maragogype (pronounced mah-rah-go-heep-eh) is another natural mutation but this time of Typica, however it really puts the MUTANT in mutation as it's a huge varietal and where Pacamara gets its bigger size from.
So how did they meet? No not at a bar on or Tinder, but in the Genetic Department of the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) back in 1958. There was a coffee breeding program using lots of varietals, these two of many, and after a great deal of work, seed distribution and trial and error, Pacamara became the amazing varietal we know it as today. For a more detailed rundown of the history of the Pacamara varietal, please have a read of the article we have on its history here.
If we had to pick 1 key flavour that this coffee is about, it'd be satsuma - a deliciously orangey cup that's certain to brighten up your day! There's some lemon at the start accompanied by white sugar, this shifts to brown sugar in the finish alongside a lightly hoppy aftertaste.

Brewing TipPacamaras have a very unique size, density and structure, so don't expect them to grind like any other coffee. We find going a little finer than you normally would and allowing more time for the grinder to get its teeth into the bigger beans often leads to delicious results.
Roasting InformationMedium - through first crack and push it steadily up to the first pops of second as it cools. Don't slow down too much or push it too far or you'll lose the intense sweetness in this cup.

As well as being a big ol' Pacamara, this is also a lil' ol' Peaberry; a thing that's normally big is a little smaller than you might expect. It's an interesting mix of unusual sizing that I hope you'll enjoy.
Normally, the seed of the coffee fruit grows into the green bean that we all know and love from two fertilised seeds inside each fruit, but sometimes things are a little different and a Peaberry is born. When only one of the two seeds is fertilised, it produces a smaller bean that looks like a shrunken version of what we'd normally know as a coffee bean, and that's because only one seed has grown instead of two.
Some say Peaberry coffees are sweeter and more delicious than their regular cousins; some people even come to us specifically looking for these coffees because they crave them so much! I'll let you be the judge.
There's bags of sweet but clean melon flavour up front, with a sweetness of brown sugar filling out as the cup cools. A delicate raisin comes in on the finish too, followed on the aftertaste by fresh lime zest. Complex, interesting and elegant.

We find going a little finer than you normally would and allowing more time for the grinder to get its teeth into the bigger beans often lead to delicious results. Don't push the grind quite as far as you would for a regular Pacamara, but still make sure to tweak what you're doing to help this coffee show off its natural awesomeness.

description: "DETAILS
This farm was brand new to us not all that long ago but has now become a regular favourite, it's always been a pleasure to get coffee from Las Delicias year after year. 
The Mierisch family (whom you may remember from such farms as Limoncillo, Mama Mina, Escondida and Cerro Azul) have worked with us for over 10 years to bring us delicious coffee.
Much of that deliciousness is thanks to their amazing processing, and Eleane Mierisch is in charge of that. She works in the family business, but she's never owned her own farm. Never, that is, until she acquired Las Delicias all for herself.
The farm is located in the region of Jinotega at an average altitude of 1,450 metres above sea level. It's located next to another Mierisch farm that you might have heard of, which is called San José. We've had coffee from there a few times; we're definitely hoping to see more in the future, too.
Eleane knows the area well, and she knows the land and what it's capable of producing. Add to this her passion for coffee, and you can start to understand why she wanted to produce coffee on a farm of her own.
The Longberry varietal is the fruit of some of the amazing experimental work that's taking place at Limoncillo, another Mierisch farm. To explain a little bit of the story behind it, Erwin Mierisch says:
Here my 'story' begins back in mid-2001. I sound like a grandfather ...My father and I were coming back from visiting some top farms in Nicaragua, as we sometimes did – and do – in order to learn from our neighbours. If we discover anything worthwhile, we then implement those things to improve efficiency and quality on our own farms.As we drove past the UNICAFE experiment station Juanetillo, which had gone under, a man on the side of the road flagged us down and explained to us how the experiment station had closed down and that his 'severance' was tools and coffee seeds since they did not have the cash to pay him. He asked if we would be interested in helping him out by purchasing these items off of him. In all honesty, I was not very happy that my father forced me to stop to see what this man wanted; therefore, I was not very receptive to his offer, but I purchased a bag of seeds and old beaten up shovels. I gave no immediate thought to the 20 lb bag of coffee seeds that was labelled as JAVA.My father later showed these seeds to our then-supervising agronomist Ing. Patricia Contreras, who had worked at that research station, and she was ecstatic. She told us about how great this coffee was, but also that it was not very productive nor resistant to disease, as she recalled from running this study at Juanetillo back in the '80s. She also said that the real name for it is Longberry, and that it has its roots in Ethiopia.We began to run some more experiments – various altitudes and processing methods – and have been learning how to manage it since.
As far as we can tell the Longberry varietal is a Typica-type coffee because of its bean shape, as is the Geisha. Its physical appearance is a uniform seed that is elongated and has been described by several of our customers as an 'Ethiopian Long Berry type'.
Super clean and refined, this coffee has got a big dose of brown sugar at the front before finishing on peaches. There’s a characteristic elegance to the whole cup, highlighted by delicate floral notes throughout.

description: "DETAILS
Our sourcing partners Beanspire have been working in Doi Pangkhon for 7 years now. Doi Pangkhon, in Chiang Rai, has 300 households, each typically producing about 1-2 tons of parchment. In the past years, Beanspire worked with each house individually on their wet processing and bought their parchment before hulling and grading at their mill
During the 2017-2018 season, there was substantial investment in a new wet mill and is currently being operated by a few trusted partner producers and allows for more control of the coffee processing. In 2018-2019 season, the mill was improved with the addition of a new roof, new pulpers and improved workflows. Only last harvest season, the mill received a new electricity generator, a cupping lab was built for the farmers, and new concrete flooring was put down too.
This is a natural processed micro lot. Coffee cherries were floated and then laid on bamboo raised beds in a one-inch layer. Under-ripes and fermented cherries were sorted out throughout the drying process and the cherries were raked multiple times each day. After the cherries were dried, they're bagged to cure for two months before milling at the dry mill.
All of the villagers belong to Akha Hilltribe and they are very young for coffee farmers, 25-35 years old, mostly. The elevation at Doi Pangkhon is from 1,250-1,4500 meters above sea level. This area is 19 degrees north of the equator, which means that this elevation is really high (e.g. Colombia Narino is 1 degree north, Costa Rica Terrazu is 9 degree north so coffee can grow beyond 1,600m there). Coffee cannot grow in Thailand above 1,550m.
The varietals here are a mixture of Typica, Catuai, SJ133 and Chiang Mai (with many unknowns as well). Chiang Mai is a local hybrid that is a cross between SL28 x Caturra x Hibrido de Timor. So it's a catimor variant (like Colombia and Castillo varietals!) that's backcrossed with SL28 in order to improve the cup quality. It's a rust-resistant cultivar that's been developed by the late Thai King as part of his effort to eradicate opium plantation by the hill tribe in the North.
In terms of green preparation, the coffee went through a destoner, huller, size grader, density table and ended with hand-sorting. The green passed through density table multiple times. The coffee was shipped coffee in a triple-layered bag, which includes a cotton bag in the outer layer, High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) in the middle layer and Grain Pro in the innermost layer.
This coffee is a sticky sweet mess of raisins and plum with a generous sprinkle of brown sugar and a dollop of double cream on it, whilst a little shoulder of dark cherry creeps in on the aftertaste.

*Please note that this coffee is sold in 125g bags, not in our regular 250g*
This is an experimental lot from Doi Saket in Chiang Mai that Beanspire worked with Nui Intakad & Aoy Jaisooksern to produce. They're a young couple who quit their day jobs in the city to return to their parents' coffee farm 5 years ago. Nui is 34 and an engineer by trade, while Aoy is 32 and an accountant by trade.
We're so proud of the coffees we've been able to source from Thailand with the help of Beanspire (check out an awesome interview Roland did with Faudi Pitsuwan from Beanspire on In My Mug episode 629 here) and think the work being done there by producers like Nui and Aoy really deserves to be shouted about.
This coffee went through an advanced processing method by any standards, a double-stage yeast inoculation. First the coffee cherries were fermented without water, using yeast that is typically used by Sauvignon blanc winemakers, in closed tanks with a one-way valve that pushed the air out, thus creating an anaerobic fermentation environment. Then after 3 days water was added, submerging the cherries, and fermented them further with a LALCAFÉ™ yeast which has been selected especially for coffee. This produces a 'sparkling' effect, hence it being called 'Sparkling Natural'.
The cherries were left to ferment in an anaerobic condition for 3 more days before being ried on raised beds.&n s produces a more complex coffee than the traditional Natural method and pushes the limits of what Thai coffee can be. The knowledge of how to perform this double-yeast inoculation experimentation came from R. Miguel Meza of Isla Custom Coffees, a processor in Hawaii, who have led the way with applying yeasts to coffee fermentation.
In terms of green preparation, the coffee went through a destoner, huller, size grader, density table and ended with handsorting. The green passed through the density table multiple times. It was shipped in a triple layered bag, which includes a cotton bag in the outer layer, High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) in the middle layer and GrainPro in the innermost layer.
The first time we tasted this coffee it was through cupping it blind and wow did we love it! In case you don't know what that means - we thought this coffee was delicious when we tasted it not knowing anything about it, we only found out about the really interesting story and processing method after tasting and scoring. This helps us taste the coffee on a blank canvas without being influenced by anything other than how it tastes. It’s got lots of Natural processing flavour to it, but in a really clean, crisp and elegant way. We’ve described it as like Nashi Pear (also called an Asian Pear, a Pear Apple or Papple, among other things!), which is a super clean and refreshing fruitiness that’s very unusual to find in a coffee.
Coffee producers are generally getting older - it’s not so common to find younger people taking it up and it’s fantastic that we’ve now been having great coffees from Nui and Aoy for several years. This is the real face of what sustainable coffee farming looks like, in a country where the cost of living is higher than in many other producing countries. It’s also a great thing about Beanspire, who handle the processing, that they’re so excited to present this coffee as what it is - a collaboration - and recognise the credit both the producers and processor deserve for their fantastic work. 
A chocolate and dark sugar base gives a full bodied foundation to this coffee, but on top of that is a fruit sweetness of cherry jam, which builds as the cup cools. The unique processing adds a clean, crisp note of Nashi pear on the finish and aftertaste which provides a refreshing balance to the sweetness and brings you back for another sip.
