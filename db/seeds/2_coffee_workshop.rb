The Producers
Grown along an isolated set of mountains stretching from Timana to Palestina in the southern part of Huila, this decaf is the work of 38 smallholder farmers, growing a mix of the typical Colombian varieties - Caturra, Castillo and Variedad Colombia. Each farmer is dedicated to producing quality outturns, which starts with harvesting ripe cherries from healthy, well-nourished trees. Selective picking requires multiple passes around the trees, as not every tree and cherry will ripen at a uniform rate. In processing their harvest the farmers first depulp and dry ferment for around 24 hours before washing, then drying under parabolic dryers or on raised beds. This attention to detail and quality coupled with the benefits brought about by the sugar cane decaffeination process results in a ripe, complete and intact flavour profile which we think makes for delicious drinking.  
The Decaffeination Process
For the last six years we’ve solely purchased decaffeinated coffees that have undergone the Sugar Cane Ethyl Acetate process. Not only does this method provide a secondary income to the producing country, but the green coffee only needs to be transported once rather than twice. Obviously more eco-friendly and less costly, it has a huge impact on cup quality too. The conditions in which coffee is transported are rarely conducive to preserving quality, and so avoiding this process from happening twice is always beneficial for the cup. The coffee, having been shipped only once unlike most decaf options that arrive into the UK via Mexico, Canada or Germany, tastes all the fresher for it.  
The actual solvent doing the work of decaffeinating the green coffee at Descafecol is derived from fermenting and making an alcohol from sugar cane. This is combined with spring water and is used to wash the caffeine out of the steamed green coffee until less than 0.1% of the original caffeine content remains.

  producer: "Maura Ochoa & William Lemus",
  description: "Travelling around Chalatenango with Caravela we were really impressed with the infrastructures in place for smallholders around La Palma to produce really complex, stable lots, which we’re proud to showcase in this lot, El Mural.
The Producers & Their Approach
Maura Ochoa is an experienced coffee producer in El Salvador’s Chalatenango region, near the town of La Palma. She is working with her son, Carlos, and his wife Ceci, who live at the farm along with their daughter, Dani. The majority of Maura’s 10 children have emigrated to the US for work, whilst Carlos is one of only two who remain to continue in the family’s business of cultivating coffee. Carlos has been working with his mother in coffee production since he was 12.
They are growing typica, pacas, pacamara and bourbon varieties, which are kept separate and undergo different processing and drying protocols. They have an ingenious solution to bring the harvested coffee cherries to the wet mill, wherein they have built a pipe network with a hopper amongst the trees which feeds the collected fruit down into a reception tank, so the pickers don’t need to carry the heavy sacks or baskets down the steep terrain.
The typica is normally dried on patios, whereas the other varieties are dried on raised beds. They are fermenting the pacamara in sealed bags, whereas the other lost are treated more traditionally in large, concrete fermentation tanks. Before depulping they float the cherries in the water used to sluice the fruit down into the reception tank, which helps to remove damaged cherries and they subsequently scan through the raised beds whilst the parchment is drying to remove ‘secos’ or ‘pods’.
The other producer who has contributed to this lot is William Lemus. At just 29 years old he has less experience than Maura and her family, but since moving back to the countryside from the city he has made some big changes to his approach to coffee production at his farm, Finca El Sauce, which is just about 1-hectare in size. Up until 3 years ago he was selling his coffee as generic, commercial coffee, but Caravela noticed the potential for quality and so he has revised his protocols.
Tending to mostly pacas, with a little pacamara, his coffee is growing under native shade trees. He is experimenting with both honey processing and a revised approach to washed coffees, wherein the coffee is held in cherry for 24 hours before depulping and is then fermented for between 18 and 24 hours to achieve the a more complex cup profile.
Caravela & Their PECA Program
We visited the producers in Chalatenango with Caravela and agronomists from their PECA program early last year. It is heartening to see their sincere dedication to improving producers’ livelihoods through dispensing valuable agronomical and economical advice.
We witnessed them not only discussing farm practices, including approaches to pruning and shade management, but also when to apply different inputs and treat their coffee trees to ensure they are performing at optimal health. Something we hadn’t seen before was their usage of a ‘Cerezometro’ or ‘cherry meter’, which is a square block with 100 indentations. It is used to assess the quality of picking, arranging 10 rows by 10 rows of coffee cherries from the least ripe to overripe, and they explain what each end of the spectrum might contribute to the cup. Less ripe cherries may introduce astringency whereas overripe cherries can impart alcoholic or even phenolic flavours.
Directly feeding back at the farm level will arm the producers with more information as to how to produce specialty quality lots, earning them a premium payment. On the back of the board, depulped parchment coffee is assessed to garner information as to how well the depulper is calibrated and see how far the fermentation has gone to ‘dial in’ the right processing approach for each farmer they are visiting with.

  producer: "David Shege & Baragwi F.C.S smallholders",
  description: "2021 marks our third year working with the sweet, tart & complex coffees from Muchagara washing station, in Kenya’s Kirinyaga region, which is produced by over a thousand coffee farmers.
The Farmers
Between 1,500 and 1,700 smallholders grow, harvest and deliver their coffee cherries to Muchagara factory to be processed. They live in the surrounding area in Kariru, and whilst a range of coffee varieties are being grown the overwhelming majority at 90% is SL34. There are pockets of SL28 as well as more recently introduced, rust-resistant varieties like Ruiru 11 and Batian. 
The agricultural conditions for growing coffee are particularly good, being located between 1,700 and 1,800m on the volcanic, southern slopes of Mount Kenya in Kirinyaga County. Coffee cherries take a long time to slowly mature and ripen, and this particular selection we’ve bought comes from the peak of the harvest, when cherries are in their prime. This contributes to more sweetness and complexity in the cup. 
Most of the smallholder farmers delivering coffee cherries have between 200 and 500 coffee trees, provided under the Baragwi F.C.S with Rainforest Alliance and 4C certificates. The collected fruit is sorted on tarps before processing, to refine the quality by removing under and over ripe cherries, and then pooled together at the mill.
The Washing Station/Factory
Established in 1959, Muchagara was the first coffee processing factory in Kenya’s Kirinyaga County. Whilst the mill itself is the oldest in Kirinyaga, the manager David Shege is relatively new and has been running operations for the last four years. His primary goals are to renovate and improve the factory’s infrastructure in order to increase the quality of their coffee. They are typically producing up to 200 tonnes of coffee per year, which puts a strain on everything from their depulping equipment, fermentation tanks and drying beds.
After depulping the coffee is fermented in tiled tanks for between 36 and 48 hours, before being fully washed and soaked in clean water from the river. Once the parchment is squeaky clean and homogenised it is dried on raised beds in the sun for between 10 and 15 days. 
The Farmer's Co-operative Society
﻿Established in 1953, the Baragwi Farmers’ Co-operative Society oversees not just the operations at Muchagara, but at 11 other factories, which are Kariru, Thimu, Karumandi, Kagongo, Guama, Kianjiru, Kianyaga, Kyanja, Gachami, Githiururi and Rwambiti. They have 16,892 registered members supplying these 12 factories with coffee cherries as well as 137 staff employed to carry out logistics and run the washing stations.  
As well as investing in producing high grade, specialty coffee the membership of the Baragwi F.C.S adhere to strong ethics which shape their methods of production. Amongst the 10 of their admirable guiding principles are a commitment to conserve the natural ecosystem, as well as aiding ecological restoration in critical areas and providing a refuge for native wildlife on their farms. They also focus on conservation of soil and water resources at the farm and factory level, using organic matter to enrich the soil as well as preventing erosion and minimising the use of chemical products through informed intercropping.

  description: "It's our third year roasting coffee from Marysabel & Moises. We’re excited to be able to continue working with the couple and showcase their reliably sweet, clean and chocolatey Catuaí coffee roasted for espresso brewing.
The Producers
Chinacla is home to a couple as passionate, positive and enthusiastic about coffee as we have met on any of our travels: Marysabel Caballero and Moises Herrera. They have around 200 hectares of farmland, an impeccable wet mill, an organised and technically advanced dry mill and an enormous warehouse to store their product. They recently upgraded from a Honduran-made Aguapulpa, which had a propensity to damage beans, to a Pinhalense Eco- Pulper.
Whilst they do some small-scale preparations of rare varieties, the majority of their Catuaí coffee is depulped and dry fermented overnight for 12-14 hours, before being washed, graded in channels and then soaked in clean water for a further 12 hours. 
Their Approach
Employing 150-200 pickers during the peak of the harvest, they aim to hire the same people as much as possible each year, however many workers are employed year-round, fulfilling tasks such as pruning, planting, removing old or sick trees and weeding so as not to have to use herbicides. This year-round support creates a stronger social bond between the Caballeros Estate and the community of Chinacla, with Marysabel explaining how being so interwoven with the local community means they don’t require extra security to combat coffee theft, as seen on many other large farms and estates in Central America. 
The Caballeros are extremely committed to the environmental sustainability of their farms. A lot of their energy and focus goes towards improving the soil of their farms to ensure a healthy growing environment for their coffee shrubs. Therefore, they produce organic fertilizer made from cow and chicken manure mixed with pulp from coffee cherries and other organic material. This is used in addition to some mineral fertilizer to ensure that the coffee plants get the nutrients they need. Oranges, avocados, flowers, bananas and other fruits are also grown at the farms, but mainly for the pickers to eat and to create biodiversity at the farms that ensures good growing conditions and shade for the coffee trees.
As Marysabel said to us “You can never get bored in coffee as there are always so many exciting projects to pursue and ways to improve”. We have to agree!
The Farm & Washing Station 
We first met with in 2019 Marysabel and Moises, and visited several of the plots across their estate. Our lot for espresso roasting this year comprises coffees from various parts of the farm collected and processed in February and March, 2021. Their main variety is Catuaí, which this lot is solely comprised of, but Moises tends to a variety garden with 27 other varieties, as well as them having plots of Java and Geisha on their large estate. The plots are marked and protected by Colpachi windbreakers and pine trees. The pine can make the soil slightly acidic and so they apply limestone to act as a neutraliser. 
Once the cherries are harvested, they depulp using a Pinhalense Eco-Pulper before the parchment is fermented for 12 hours. It is then washed and at the same time floaters and underdeveloped beans are removed in grading channels. After washing, the beans are soaked for about 12 hours in running clean water. Utilising equipment that we’ve never witnessed before, the wet coffee is then spun in a centrifuge to remove excess water before being laid out on patios for around 8-10 hours to initially drain before being dried in slowly rotating, low temperature guardiolas.

  description: "Never far from our own team's lips when we’re discussing favourite coffees from the past, we’re thrilled to welcome Dely Suyapa back into our filter coffee range.
The Region
We travelled to Honduras for the first time in February 2019. Our intentions were to identify and meet with dedicated coffee producers whose coffee we wanted to bring back to the UK to roast, hopefully being able to forge relationships that would stand for many years.
We first cupped through several tables of fresh offers with Rony at RAGA coffee, alongside our longstanding partners Nordic Approach, and were blown away by the quality and vibrancy of the cup profiles from smallholders in Pozo Negro in Masaguara.
A favourite of ours that stood out on the table every time we cupped it was produced by Dely Suyapa Matute Ramirez. We went out to visit her the following day.
The Producer
Dely and her family were very welcoming, offering us coffee and snacks in her house sitting amidst her coffee trees and close to their newly built Secadores (polytunnels for drying coffee). When we visited, they still had around two thirds of this year’s harvest still to pick and process. We got a tour around her farm, Finca Las Manzanas, which is around 10 years old and is planted with Bourbon, Catuaí and Lempira across 1 hectare. She has recently implemented a system to keep the varieties separate for processing, which is why we’ve been able to secure a lot comprised of entirely Bourbon. 
Next door to her farm is her husband’s, and then her son and daughter also have farms nearby, named El Durazno and La Bonita. She has six children in total, and the whole family is working in coffee production, helping each other out when it comes to harvest time. Her grandchildren are too young to pick coffee yet! 
Dely is a warm and hospitable lady, passionate about producing high quality coffee, and was proud to show us some of her certificates from placing in the Honduras Cup of Excellence competition in past years.
Their Approach
Once harvested, Dely checks the Brix of the coffee cherries, a way to measure the sugar concentration, which she relies on as indicative of the ripeness of the parcel of fruit, subsequently adjusting her fermentation periods to ensure optimal processing from picking to picking. We saw a range from 24 to 40 hours of dry fermentation on the sheets Dely showed us, used to log the processing data from each batch of coffee. Timing the fermentation is very important, but they are hoping to invest in a thermometer and pH reader to be able to measure the fermentation in more detail, and along more parameters than time alone. 
We’re thrilled to share this Bourbon selection from Finca Las Manzanas with you, and hope you enjoy its vibrant, juicy, and tingly characteristics.

  producer: "470 smallholders",
  description: "Our first Ethiopian release from the early 2021 pickings, we are really excited by the cup profile of this stunning Guji coffee, produced in the Yabitu kebele of Uraga.
The Producers
Just shy of 500 smallholder farmers have grown the coffee that has been compiled into this lot. Their farms are typically very small and are a combination of semi-forest and wholly cultivated. They are planted out with a mixture of pulses and vegetables, as well as a mixture of local coffee varieties, including Wolisho, Dega, JARC74110 and JARC74112. The soil is a fertile red clay type, but what really contributes to the Uraga woreda being a hotbed for high quality coffee production is that the farms are situated between 2,100 and 2,200 metres above sea level. This creates a strong diurnal swing in temperatures, creating more acids in the coffee and greater density. 
The Washing Station
Once the coffee cherries are selectively harvested by hand they are delivered to the wet mill in the Yabitu Koba kebele. They are traditionally depulped with an Agaarde disc-pulper before fermenting under water for 36 hours to break down the mucilage layer in a clean, controlled fashion. Once scrubbed clean in long grading channels, which refine the coffee’s quality by effectively density sorting it, the coffee is then soaked to homogenise, stabilise and further clean the parchment layer, before being put onto raised beds in thin layers to dry in the sun. 
The results of the propagation and process of this coffee are a very fruity, complex cup, which we have found to have mellowed out over the months since picking. Initially the coffee possessed a prickly, paper-like quality, a bit like when you taste very fresh olive oil. This has given way to more honeyed and tropical sweetness, with the mouthfeel becoming more saturated and the aromas more pronounced as the coffee has rested out.

Having thoroughly enjoyed several coffees from washing stations owned and operated by Snap Coffee last year, including Raro Boda, Refisa and Danche, we have been pursuing further lots from them this year to strengthen our relationship with them whilst continuing to showcase the best coffees we can possibly find. 
The Farmers
Around 257 farmers delivered their coffee cherries to the Raro Boda washing station, located in Guji Zone’s Uraga woreda. Amidst natural forest and vegetation they are working completely organically, tending to a range of varieties, some of which are improved landrace selections such as Wolisho, Dega & Kurume.
There are also pockets of JARC (Jimma Agricultural Research Center) identified and released varieties, dubbed 74110 and 74112 after having been initially catalogued in 1974, which are being promoted due to their resistance to coffee berry disease. Each farmer tends to between 2,000 and 4,000 coffee trees.
The Washing Station & Their Approach
Named after the kebele (small town), Raro Boda washing station has been recently refurbished and fitted out with a Penagos depulper and beautifuly white tiled fermentation tanks. These innovations and investments allow greater control over the processing of the fruit delivered by smallholders in the kebele.
They traditionally process the coffee by depulping and fermenting under water for 48 hours before the parchment coffee is graded, initially in washing channels and then by hand during the time it spends drying in the sun on raised beds. To ensure uniform drying the layers are spread around 2cm deep and spend 10 days or so before they are consolidated, and samples are sent to the cupping lab. 
Raro Boda wet mill has a new QC manager, Medhin Tamiru, an experienced cupper with over a decade of experience in the industry, and who was a judge for the last Ethiopian Cup of Excellence competition. He will continue to oversee operations ensuring the coffee produced at Raro Boda is squeaky clean and of the highest quality. 
The Exporter
Snap Coffee was established in 2008 by Negusse Debela Weldyes, and are responsible for the running and operation of several coffee washing stations including Raro Boda and Riripa, both of which will feature in our coffee range this year. Abenezer Asfaw oversees logistics and supply chain mapping, and is the liaison for Tropiq, which is Nordic Approach’s sister company with a team on the ground in Ethiopia year-round.
Abenezer and his team oversee the processing facilities but also take on the task of dispensing agricultural knowledge to their contributing farmers. They are committed to recycling waste by-products from coffee processing at each of their stations where they have also built schools and provided them with computing equipment from the other arm of their business which is in electronics. They intend to improve the roads to streamline access to the washing stations as well as build health clinics to provide access to better healthcare for their contributing farmers. 
Lots from the most recent pickings will be dry milled at Snap’s new processing and warehousing facility, which has just been fitted out. This means they will have even more control over the final exportable product that we get to work with, hopefully leading to improved consistency and uniformity.
