# About Us

We wanted a way to be able to keep track of how we were brewing our coffees, and what our favourite coffees are! The apps that we looked at to do this didn't make us want to use them, and we're developers... so here we are. Well, more specifically, we're here and we're open source on GitHub.

We want to build something which shows off how good the web can be. No ads, no tracking, no big auto pop ups. We've built Daily Brew with Rails 7 and leaning into the Hotwire approach to minimise JavaScript.

One of the questions that I always ask when I'm using a free piece of software is how does it make money? At the moment, Daily Brew runs for free on Heroku, which helps with reducing costs. The plan is that the brew logging journal portion of the app will remain free. We're then looking to do something a bit different with a coffee subscription - but that's coming soon.

So the only other real cost is our time. At the moment Daily Brew is a hobby project. We're building something that we want to use. If this is something that you want to use too, please do so! If there is a feature you want, then get in touch and let us know. If you're like us and you fall into that portion of the Venn diagram that is both software developer and coffee drinker (as we think quite a lot of people are) and you want to help out, add a feature, or fix a bug then head over to GitHub!

Archer, Gareth and Phil are the three who had the idea and started building this. If you want to buy any of them a coffee, you can do so below.
