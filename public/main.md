### With Daily Brew, you can log your brews, keep track of what methods works best, discover roasters, coffees and more.

## Public Beta
We're still hard at work on Daily Brew. To say that there are going to be rough edges would be understating how far along
in development we are! If you're here now, that's great. Your feedback can really help shape what we're building.

### Key Features

- Keep **track the coffees you have on your shelf**
- **Record your brews** and rate them, hopefully make each one a little better.
- **Save your favourite** coffees (I can never remember which ones were the best!)
- **Discover new Roasters** from our BIG list of UK roasters.
- **Search for Coffees** by name, region, tasting notes or process.
- **Control the privacy** of your brews and your profile. Want to share? Great! Want to be a stealthy coffee ninja? That's cool too.

### Features we’re working on.
- **Consumable tracking** - keep track of how many filter papers and other consumables you have left.
- **Better Recommendations** - Based on the ratings you give to your coffees, we’ll work to recommend what could be a good
next coffee to try.
- **Better Filters** - We have a search which works for coffees and roasters at the moment but we're going to add some
filters too. If you have any suggestions please let us know.
- **More tips and pointers**
- **Dark mode**
- **Keep track of consumables** Automatically decrease the number of filter papers you have on your coffee shelf when making a brew
- **Keep track of how much coffee you have left** Automatically subtract how much coffee you've used in a brew when you log it, so you know how much you have left rather than just picking up the bag!
- **Review Coffees** Leave reviews on the coffees you've tried and read others reviews
- **Public Reviews** See what coffee reviews other people have shared
- **Loads more coffees!** (Hint: you can help with this!)
- **Live Brew Map** A map which shows approximate locations for public brews

### Open and Transparent
We're building Daily Brew in public. If there is anything that you think we should be sharing, but we're not, then let
us know, and we'll see what we can do. There's more info about this on the [About Us](/about) page.
