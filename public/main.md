With Daily Brew, you can log your brews, keep track of what methods works best, discover roasters, coffees and more.

## Public Beta
We're still working on Daily Brew. To say that there are going to be rough edges would be understating how far along
in development we are! If you're here now that's great, your feedback can really help shape what we're building.

### Features we’re working on.
Consumable tracking - keep track of how many filter papers and other consumables you have left.
Better Recommendations - Based on the ratings you give to your coffees, we’ll work to recommend what could be a good
next coffee to try.
Better Filters - We have a search which works for coffees and roasters at the moment but we're going to add some
filters too. If you have any suggestions please let us know.

### Open and Transparent
We're building Daily Brew in public. If there is anything that you think we should be sharing, but we're not, then let
us know and we'll see what we can do. There's more info about this on the [About Us](/about) page.
